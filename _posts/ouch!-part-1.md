## Overview

Back in 2017, I was the _victim_ of a **hit and run**. I suffered major injuries that took many months of therapy to recover. Here's my story.

## The Incident

For some context, I had recently _left_ the US _Army_ and was **attending university**.

On the night of the incident, there were _two_ things of **note**:

- I had an _evening class_ that lasted til **8pm**.

- I had a _midterm test_ the next morning, which I **wasn't prepared** for.

I knew I was in for a _long night_ of **studying**. So after the night class had ended, I grabbed some food, before making my way back to my apartment.

Parking was difficult to find that night, so I _settled_ on some **street parking** about half a mile from the residence.

I _parked_ my car and **got out** with my backpack and food in my hands. This was the _last memory_ I could recall, because the next moment after, I found myself waking up on **hospital bed** choking on an [endotracheal tube](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539747/).

> Apparently, I had been _unconcious_ for a **couple hours**. It was as if I'd been swept into a _portal_ and **time traveled** to a hospital. The experience was _surreal_.

My body was _unnoticeable_. My legs were were _covered_ in **bloodied bandages** and **throbbing** with aches. The left part of _my face_ was stiff, covered in _patches_ of **dried blood**.

There was a _distinctive pain_ on my **left hand**. Apparently, it was _nerve damage_. My fingers felt as though they were being _lit_ under a **constant, blazing fire**.

I had suffered an _open compound fracture_ on my **left tibia** and a _closed fracture_ on my **right**. _Metal rods_ were **inserted** in both legs through a procedure called [Intramedullary Nailing](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tibia-shinbone-shaft-fractures/#:~:text=Intramedullary%20nailing.&text=During%20this%20procedure%2C%20a%20specially,in%20proper%20position%20during%20healing.).

The _reality_ of the situation started to **sink in**. I knew _overcoming_ this was going to be my biggest **challenge** yet.

## What Happened?

After I'd gathered my bearings, i had plenty of _questions_ that needed **answers**...

#### _"What in the world happened?"_

- Unfortunately, **nobody** had a **clear response**. The only reliable information was from an eye witness testimony: A **black SUV** traveling **40-50 mph** had struck me and **fled** the scene immediately afterwards. It was a **hit and run**.

#### _"Will I be able walk/run again?"_

- **Yes**, with therapy and proper care, **full recovery** should be expected.

#### _"How long will that be?"_

- **2 weeks** - slow walk with assistance
- **1 month** - unassisted slow walk
- **2 months** - back to normal walk
- **3 months** - slow jog
- **4 months** - 90-100% recovery

#### _"What about my test?"_

- Your **blood tests** came back **normal**. Nothing to worry about there.

#### _"No, I meant my midterm test"_

- ...your midterm test? Well, you're in **no condition** to be taking a test. You'll be here for least a week. Your **focus** should be **recovery**.

#### _So ... no test?_

They say every cloud has a silver lining ..... **I'll take it**.
