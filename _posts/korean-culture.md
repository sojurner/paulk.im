## Before I Begin...

I had the pleasure of living in Korea from **2013 - 2015**. During that time, I made it a personal goal to _embrace_ and _experience_ all that the country had to offer with an **open mind**. In doing so, I learned a great deal about the _societal_ & _cultural_ norms that dominated its **modern society**. By no means has two years made me an _expert_ on this subject matter. Nonetheless, here are a list of some of Korea's _cultural practices_ that had me **scratching my head**.

## The Age Heirarchy

_Age_ has unbelievably overbearing power in Korea. Simply being older, means entitlement to unconditional respect, formal addressment, and priority in almost every social and political agenda (opinions, benefits, etc).

I understand the intent and logic behind this culutral practice, but it has become a convenient, unreliable, and rigid approach to establishing a contextual heirarchy.

To me, its assuming that age and wisdom invariably follow a positive correlation. While being older represents more lived opportunities, actually learning from them is the bridge to the growth and wisdom that earns respect. Having had opportunites is important, but developing from them should be the line of difference.

## K-Pop & K-Drama

The _Korean entertainment_ industry is, behind all of its fluff, just sugar. From a creative perspective, it offers little to no appeal.

Year in and year out, there's virtually been zero artistic variation between _K-pop_ songs. They all follow the same formula, reenact the same routine, recite the same lyrics, wear the same outfits, and dance to the same beat. Just listen to one song and you'll have heard all of them.

Unfortunately, K-Dramas are not too far different from their distant cousin. For the most part, every drama series plays out the same diluted, drawn-out, and over-romantacized storyline.

For me, the most unappealing aspect of K-dramas is the lack of true _character development_, and instead, focus on _relationship development_. Rarely, will the main characters change/grow introspectively, but as a result of circumstantial relationship events that force their hand.

In general, progression within Korean entertainment has been festered, because of reluctance to experiment and adopt new ideas. The executives at the top, who lead the industry charge, often default to safe and proven methods, rather than going for it with different, unique ideas.

I may sound overly critical, but I say this out of hope for a positive reform within the industry.

## The Education System

One of the many blessings that I'm constantly grateful for, is that I've never had to go through the _Korean education system_. I for sure would not have lasted in its brutal and unforgiving environment. Oddly, this devoid of compassion system is all geared towards one test, [수능](https://borgenproject.org/tag/the-suneung/).

![K-nerds](https://koreanstudyblogdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/120.jpg)

_수능 (suneung)_ is basically their SAT's but with life implications. Frighteningly, performance on this test will paint the future outlook of the student with little to no exception. It dictates which colleges they can attend, which in turn, determines which jobs they can get, leading to how much they can earn, and ultimately, where in the social ladder they'll be placed. An anecdote from one of my past friends, illustrated a typical day during his high school years:

- 6:30am - wakeup, breakfast
- 8:00am - start of school
- 12:20pm - lunch for 30 min
- 4:20pm - end of school
- 5:00pm - supplemental classes
- 6:00pm - dinner
- 7:00pm - self study (in school) until 9~11pm
- 11:30pm - go home and sleep

The educuation system needs reformation. Year after year, [Korea has led in every negative mental health statistic](koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200427000687). Since 2007, suicide has been the No. 1 cause of death for teenagers. In 2019, 28.2% of middle & high school students reported some form of depression. The list of damning statistical evidence is virtually endless. No matter how the numbers are framed, Korea does not look good.

## The Work Culture

In a nutshell, Korea's work culture operates similarly to its age heirarchy, but instead of age, it's company rank.

Those who are higher up in the corporate ladder have so-called _unspoken_ privileges of control and **absuive power** within the group. I agree that individuals holding executive positions of greater responsibilities, should receieve a certain level of respect. However, in the context of Korea, there is a sense of entitlement and freedom to behave imprudently with lower ranking employees'.

Often these higher-ups will schedule "mandatory" after work gatherings, such as _late dinner at a bar_ or _karaoke night_. To add to the sulk, these "gatherings" are usually held during the middle of the week, where employees are still required to wake up early the next morning for work.

> They involve heavy drinking and obsequious gesturing towards superiors, lasting deep into the night. Anyone showing a lack of enthusiasm is immediately pointed out and ostracized. As you can imagine, these situations become a hotbed for fraternization.

Unfortunately, these gatherings are "mandatory" in the sense that refusal to attend leads to unfavorable consequences that can deeply affect chances of a promotion or raise.

All the friends that I've made during 2013-2015, have grown-up and gotten jobs. Sadly, almost each hate their current situations because of this soul-crushing work culture. They are forced to drink for long hours after a grueling work day, and wake up early the next morning only to repeat it again.

## Plastic Surgery

This has been a controversial subject in Korea for as long as I can remember. The idea of going under the knife for cosmetic purposes, has slowly been normalized into a neutral-positive narrative. To me, this is an outcry of insecurity and lack of self-confidence due to a socially cutthroat, competitive culture. The fear of ostracism and the deep desire to succeed, has translated into a mentally harmed society.

If someone is determined to partake in a cosmetic procudure, by all means, they should have freedom of choice to do so. However, normalizing this practice is overlooking deeper systemic issues of self-esteem that can be seen in other factions of their society.

## Conclusion

Being of korean descent, I often wonder how emotionally and intellectually different I'd be had I been raised in Korea. Would I be supportive of these cultural practices or would I still share the same skepticism and perplexities as I do now, as an American?  Only one can wonder...
