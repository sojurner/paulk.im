## Recap

I had sustained serious injuries as a result of a hit and run. A long road to recovery was ahead.

## The first week

*First week* was one of the worst I'd **experienced**. Nerve damage on my left hand was a *fiery pain* that kept me **up at night**. My brittle legs could only support *one* or *two* **sleeping positions**, which led to **incredible discomfort**. Nothing about the *week* was **enjoyable**.

My *limited mobility* made simple and routine tasks **10x** more difficult. Stuff you'd never think twice about, such as *getting water*, *going to the bathroom*, and *changing clothes* were near **impossible** without assistance.

I would first experience the **restrictive nature** of my situation through the **Bedpan**.

## The Bedpan

During this week, I had consumed loads of *pain meds* and consequently, was unable to **"do my busineess"**. By day 4, the buildup had reached **critical mass**, and there was no where left for it but (pun intended) out.

However, there was a *problem*. I was virtually **glued to my hospital bed**. Surgery had only been a couple days ago, and, thus was unable lift my legs. This meant using the restroom was not an available option. *My only choice was the Bedpan*.

> Another *item of note* that would play a factor, was I couldn't sit **upright**. The *furthest achievable* sitting angle I could reach was about **140Â°**. As you can imagine, that's practically a *straight line*.

The *first aspect* of the challenge was getting the **bedpan** under my bottom. Because of the *nerve damage* on my left hand, it was **motorless**. While doing this with only *my right arm* was **difficult**, at this point, I had *no other choice*. My pride was shook and too *fragile* for a nurse to get **involved**. It was *essential* that I did this **unassisted**.

Eventually, with *grit & determination* (and perhaps out of *desparation*), I was able to get the bedpan **underneath**. All that was *left to do was* the **actual act**.

As I began this portion of the challenge, the *question loomed* in my mind: **"How how long is this going to take?"**.

Unfortunately, the *answer* would be **"Yes"**.

The *awkward sitting position*, *straight stiff legs*, and *3+ days of constipation* made the entire experience **whimsically difficult**. No matter how hard I *pushed*, it fought back **effortlessly**.  Every *attempt* to adjust my sitting position, was rejected by the *inner edges* of the bedpan **piercing** my butt cheeks.  *Nothing* I did seemed to add any **progress** towards the goal.

After what seemed like an eternity of [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus), it finally started to give in. The light at the end of the tunnel began to appear. Now, came the most *important* step, **the setup**.  I gave some minor *nudges* to get it as **close to the door** as possible.  Eventually, it ready for the final move...

I exhaled...I was rewarded with release.  It felt as though I had emerged from a cocoon.

My sheets were *drenched in sweat*, while **tears of remorse** lined my cheeks.  After briefly *relishing the moment*, I took an intriguing look **inside** the bedpan.

The enormity of its *size* and profound *measurements* were beyond **awe-inspiring**.  This was, with a doubt, the *new number 1* on my **all-time size list**.

The *nurse* swung by to **collect the bedpan**. As she *picked it up*, her **eyes dilated**. Oddly enough, her *curiousity* pulled her towards taking a **peek**.  Immediately, she *shot* me a **dumbfounded** look.

I returned it with a *proud*, *lofty* **smile**.

Strangely, on sleepy days such as today, I *think back* to that **moment**. Almost always, I'm left with *regret*.
*Regret* that I didn't take a **picture**.
